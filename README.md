## RecoilClone: Simple State Management for React

RecoilClone is a lightweight state management library inspired by Recoil, designed to simplify state handling in React applications. With RecoilClone, you can create atoms and selectors to manage your application's state effortlessly. Below are the key features and hooks provided by RecoilClone.

### `atom`

The `atom` function allows you to create independent state containers, similar to Recoil atoms. Define your state with an initial value using this hook.

```javascript
// Create an atom for counter state with an initial value of 0
export const counterState = atom({
  default: 0,
});
```

### `selector`

The `selector` function enables you to create derived state, just like Recoil selectors. Use this hook to compute and derive state from existing atoms.

```javascript
// Create a selector to check if the counterState is greater than 10
export const checkGreater = selector({
  get: ({ get }) => {
    const state = get(counterState);
    if (state > 10) {
      return "greater than 10";
    }
    return "less than 10";
  },
});
```

### `useRecoilValue`

The `useRecoilValue` hook is similar to Recoil's `useRecoilValue`, allowing you to access the current value of an atom or a selector.

```javascript
// Access the current value of counterState
const count = useRecoilValue(counterState);

// Access the value of the checkGreater selector
const selectorValue = useRecoilValue(checkGreater);
```

### Important Note:

- RecoilClone provides a Recoil-like experience for state management in React applications.
- Define atoms using `atom` and create derived states with selectors using `selector`.
- Access the current value of atoms or selectors using the `useRecoilValue` hook.

Now you can leverage the simplicity and power of RecoilClone to streamline state management in your React applications, similar to using Recoil. Happy coding!
